Background Information on task:
There are several Game Development Engines that can be used to develop a game: Frostbite, Unreal, Unity, and others. 
Frostbite Engine is the technology behind EA Games and is the core piece of EA's one-team strategy; through the sharing of 
technology between studios we are creating a shared language for EA developers. Frostbite Engine is not open-source. We have included a video in the Resources section (below) that 
teaches you more about Frostbite, however this video won't form part of the task.
Given the proprietary nature of Frostbite, you will use an open-source engine for this task. Unreal Engine is a commonly used open-source engine and is a complete suite of development 
tools for anyone working with real-time technology, from design visualizations and cinematic experiences to high-quality games across PC, console, mobile, VR, and AR.  

Actual Task:
In the previous tasks you have implemented Vax-Man in Python and C++. In this task, you need to think about how you would use Unreal Engine to implement Vax-Man.
    Step 1:  Review the information included in the Resources (below).
    Step 2:  Think through how you could implement Vax-Man using Unreal Engine, what steps you will need to take, and what issues you will need to address.
    Step 3:  Go to 'Submit your work' below and input your answers into the text box. This will be your deliverable for this task.
