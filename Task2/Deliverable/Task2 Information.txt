Background Information on task:
Python is an excellent development language. But it has performance limits. When implementing more resource-intensive games, the industry standards are C++ and C#. The choice of language will depend on the platform you use. EA work is done on C++.
 To recap, we are building a new game called Vax-Man. The rules are similar to Pac-Man with several notable exceptions:
    Vax-Man can kill a ghost if he comes into contact with it (vaccinates it).
    Contact with a ghost does not kill Vax-Man.
    Each ghost that has not yet been hit multiplies itself every 30 seconds (the infection grows).
    The goal of the game is to collect all the dots before the number of ghosts grows to 32 times the original number.

Actual Task:
In this task you need to do the following:
    Step 1: Review open-source C++ Pac-Man implementations. We've included a couple of them for reference in the Resources below, but you can use any open-source C++ implementation.
    Step 2: Pick one of the open-source implementations and download it.
    Step 3: Modify it based on the rules of Vax-Man.
    Step 4: Go to 'Submit your work' below and upload your modified code. This will be your deliverable for this task.
